\title{Calculate Overall Median Survival Time from Mixed Exponential Distributions}
\usage{
mstfromExpdists(sample_sizes, MST_subgroups, search_range = c(0, 100))
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_sizes}{Numeric vector of sample sizes for each subgroup}

\item{MST_subgroups}{Numeric vector of median survival times for each subgroup (same length as sample_sizes)}

\item{search_range}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the search interval for uniroot (default: c(0, 100))}
}
\value{
List containing:
  \item{subgroup_summary}{Data frame with subgroup details (subgroup, sample_size, MST)}
  \item{MST_overall}{Overall median survival time for the mixed population}
}
\description{
This function calculates the overall median survival time for a mixed population
composed of multiple subgroups, each following exponential distributions with
different median survival times. The overall population follows a mixture of
exponential distributions.
}
\details{
The function assumes that each subgroup follows an exponential distribution with
the specified median survival time. The overall population is modeled as a mixture
of exponential distributions with mixing probabilities proportional to sample sizes.

Mathematical formulation:
\deqn{S(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{k} p_j \exp(-\lambda_j t)}
where \eqn{p_j = n_j / \sum n_j} is the mixing probability for subgroup j,
\eqn{\lambda_j = \ln(2) / MST_j} is the hazard rate for subgroup j, and
\eqn{MST_j} is the median survival time for subgroup j.

The overall median survival time is found by solving:
\deqn{S(t_{median}) = 0.5}
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Two subgroups
sample_sizes <- c(100, 150)
MST_subgroups <- c(6, 7.5)
result <- mstfromExpdists(sample_sizes, MST_subgroups)
print(result$subgroup_summary)
print(paste("Overall MST:", round(result$MST_overall, 2), "months"))

# Example 2: Three subgroups
sample_sizes <- c(200, 300, 100)
MST_subgroups <- c(8, 12, 15)
result <- mstfromExpdists(sample_sizes, MST_subgroups)
print(result$subgroup_summary)
print(paste("Overall MST:", round(result$MST_overall, 2), "months"))
