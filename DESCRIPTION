Description: Provides tools for survival analysis from published Kaplan-Meier 
    tables using the person-years method. Estimates hazard rates and median 
    survival time from digitized Kaplan-Meier curve data, assuming exponential 
    distribution within each interval. It also includes simulation functions 
    for validation of the estimation methods. The package includes real-world 
    examples including analysis of KEYNOTE-859 clinical trial data.
